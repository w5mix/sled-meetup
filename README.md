## Build Your Own Cloud-Based E2E Testing Platform

- [x] ~~step 1 | a local jest-lambda-runner~~
- ðŸ‘‰ [ ] **step 2 | a remote test execution (the function)**
- [ ] step 3 | a headless browser runtime setup (the layer)
- [ ] step 4 | wiring the browser to your local test

** NOTE - the remote jest execution will not work, because we've yet to install the lambda layer (all needed runtime dependecies, including jest).
